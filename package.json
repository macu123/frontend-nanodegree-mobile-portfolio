  "description": "Website Performance Optimization portfolio project<br> <br> How to run this project?<br> <br> 1. Open http://macu123.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/ using any major browser.<br> 2. Visit <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights\">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> using any major browser.<br> 3. Copy the url of the project into the blank to get the score of index.html.<br> 4. Then it should get higher than 90 for both Mobile and Desktop.<br> 5. Navigate to Pizza.html and open the console of the browser.<br> 6. When you scroll in the page, it will output frame per second (FPS). The FPS should be consistently higher than 60fps.<br> 7. When use slider to change the size of pizzas, it will output the time to resize of pizzas. It should be below 5ms.<br> <br> Bonus: Although project-mobile.html, project-webperf.html and project-2048.html are not required, I still optimize them to achieve pagespeed scores higher than 90 for both Mobile and Desktop. :)<br> <br> What steps did I take to optimize the website?<br> <br> 1. Copy required font css from Google Font API into style.css, and delete google font css file to remove render-blocking css.<br> 2. Move out all the critical css from style.css, and inline it into the body to remove render-blocking css.<br> 3. Put the remaining style.css in the end of html file, and use loadCSS to load it asychronisely.<br> 4. Add media type to print.css to remove render-blocking css.<br> 5. Add async attributes to all js files that have nothing to do with page rendering to remove render-blocking javascript.<br> 6. Compress and resize the size of images to speedup rendering.<br> 7. Change all querySelector to getElementById and querySelectorAll to getElementsByClassName to speedup FPS.<br> 8. Use jQuery batch DOM update instead of individual DOM update to speed up time to resize pizzas.<br> 9. Reduce total number of pizzas rendering from 100 to 22 to speed up FPS.",
